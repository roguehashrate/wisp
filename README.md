# Wisp

A minimal, performant Android client for the [Nostr](https://nostr.com) protocol. Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, Wisp prioritizes decentralization, intelligent relay routing, and a clean native experience.

> **Status:** Early alpha (v0.1.0) — actively developed, expect breaking changes.

## Why Wisp

Most Nostr clients treat relays as interchangeable dumb pipes. Wisp takes a different approach — it implements the outbox/inbox relay model from day one, routing messages intelligently based on where users actually publish and read. The result is faster event delivery, less wasted bandwidth, and a client that actively promotes the decentralized architecture Nostr was designed for.

Wisp is built to be fast, lightweight, and respectful of both your device and the relay network.

---

## Key Features

### Intelligent Outbox/Inbox Relay Routing

Wisp implements a full outbox/inbox model with relay scoring:

- **Outbox reads**: Fetches a user's posts from their *write relays* (where they actually publish), not from a hardcoded list
- **Inbox writes**: Delivers replies and reactions to a user's *read relays* (where they actually look), ensuring they see your interactions
- **Relay scoring**: Tracks relay reliability and author coverage to optimize which relays to query, minimizing redundant connections
- **Smart relay hints**: When tagging events, selects relay hints that overlap between your outbox and the target's inbox for optimal discoverability
- **Ephemeral connections**: Dynamically opens short-lived relay connections as needed (up to 30) with automatic cleanup after 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Fallback strategies**: Gracefully degrades to broadcast mode for users without published relay lists

### Performance First

- **LRU caching** across events (5,000), profiles, reactions, reposts, and zaps — data is fetched once and reused
- **Off-main-thread processing**: All event parsing and relay communication runs on background dispatchers
- **Debounced UI updates**: Feed emissions are coalesced to one per 16ms frame, preventing excessive recompositions from rapid relay events
- **Deduplication**: Atomic check-then-put prevents the same event from being processed twice across multiple relays
- **Lazy profile loading**: Metadata is fetched asynchronously in batches with periodic sweep cycles
- **Relay cooldowns**: Failed relays get a 5-minute cooldown before retry, preventing connection storms

### Promotes Decentralization from the Start

- No hardcoded "mega-relay" dependency — default relays are starting points, not requirements
- First-class NIP-65 relay list support encourages users to publish their own relay preferences
- Outbox model means the client respects *where users choose to publish*, not where the client developer decided to look
- Blocked relay support (NIP-51 kind 10006) lets users opt out of specific relays entirely
- DM relay sets (NIP-51 kind 10050) allow separate relay infrastructure for private messaging
- Blossom media uploads distribute content across decentralized media servers instead of centralized CDNs

### Lightning Wallet

Wisp includes a built-in non-custodial Lightning wallet powered by [Breez SDK (Spark)](https://github.com/niclas9/breez-sdk-spark), with NWC as an alternative:

- **Embedded Spark wallet**: Self-custodial Lightning node that runs on-device — no external wallet app needed
- **Seed phrase backup**: 12-word mnemonic for wallet recovery on any device
- **Encrypted relay backup**: Back up wallet credentials to your Nostr relays, encrypted with your private key, and restore from any session
- **NWC support**: Alternatively connect any [NIP-47](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/47.md) compatible wallet via `nostr+walletconnect://` URI
- **Lightning address**: Set up and share a reusable Lightning address for receiving payments
- **Transaction history**: Paginated transaction list with counterparty resolution from zap receipts
- **QR code scanning**: Scan or import QR codes to pay Lightning invoices
- **Zaps**: Send Lightning zaps to posts with optional messages, with zap receipt tracking on the feed

### Blossom Media Support

- Upload images and media to decentralized [Blossom](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom) servers
- Manage your server list (kind 10063) with per-account isolation
- Nostr event-based authentication for uploads (kind 24242)
- Multi-server fallback — tries each configured server until one succeeds
- Automatic EXIF stripping where supported by the server

### Private Messaging

- **NIP-17 gift wrap encryption**: Three-layer privacy model (rumor → seal → gift wrap) with timestamp randomization
- **NIP-44 modern encryption**: ECDH + HKDF + XChaCha20 + HMAC-SHA256, replacing legacy NIP-04
- **Conversation key caching**: Expensive ECDH computations are cached per peer
- **Separate DM relays**: Publish DMs to dedicated relay sets for better privacy

### Safety Controls

- Mute lists (NIP-51 kind 10000) for blocking pubkeys
- Keyword muting for content filtering
- Relay blocking to opt out of specific relays
- All safety lists sync across clients via published Nostr events

### Additional Features

- **Thread view** with NIP-10 reply threading and root resolution
- **Notifications** aggregating mentions, reactions, and zaps
- **Search** for profiles and content
- **Bookmarks and pins** (NIP-51)
- **Custom follow sets** (NIP-51 kind 30000) as alternative feed sources
- **Reposts** with tracking and display
- **Emoji reactions** (NIP-25) with custom emoji picker
- **NIP-05 DNS verification** with caching
- **NIP-19 bech32 encoding** — npub, nsec, note, nevent, nprofile support
- **Nostr URI rendering** in post content (nostr:npub..., nostr:note...)
- **QR code display** for sharing keys and profiles
- **Multiple account support** with per-account encrypted storage
- **Biometric authentication** for key access
- **Relay console** for debugging relay communication
- **Profile editing** with metadata publishing
- **Onboarding flow** with follow suggestions for new users

## Architecture

Wisp follows an MVVM architecture with clear layer separation:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   UI Layer                   │
│         Jetpack Compose Screens              │
│    (FeedScreen, ThreadScreen, DmScreen...)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│               ViewModel Layer                │
│   FeedViewModel, ThreadViewModel,            │
│   DmConversationViewModel, WalletViewModel   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              Repository Layer                │
│  EventRepo, ContactRepo, DmRepo, NwcRepo,   │
│  RelayListRepo, BlossomRepo, MuteRepo...     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              Protocol Layer                  │
│   Nip01, Nip02, Nip10, Nip17, Nip19,        │
│   Nip25, Nip44, Nip47, Nip51, Nip57, Nip65  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│               Relay Layer                    │
│   RelayPool, OutboxRouter, RelayScoreBoard,  │
│   SubscriptionManager, Relay (WebSocket)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **No database**: All state is held in-memory (LRU caches) or in SharedPreferences/EncryptedSharedPreferences. This keeps the app simple and fast — events are fetched from relays on each session, as Nostr intended.
- **NIP objects**: Each NIP is implemented as a Kotlin `object` with static helper functions (e.g., `Nip17.createGiftWrap()`), making the protocol layer modular and testable.
- **Flow-based reactivity**: SharedFlow for relay events, StateFlow for UI state. No RxJava, no LiveData — pure coroutines.
- **Encrypted key storage**: Private keys never touch plain SharedPreferences. AES256-GCM via Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher
- A Nostr keypair (you can generate one in-app or import an existing nsec)

### Installation

APK downloads will be available on the [Releases](../../releases) page once published.

### First Launch

1. **Create or import a key** — Generate a fresh keypair or paste your existing `nsec`
2. **Set up your profile** — The onboarding flow walks you through name, picture, and bio
3. **Follow some people** — Wisp suggests popular accounts to get your feed started
4. **Configure relays** — Your relay list is published as a NIP-65 event so other outbox-aware clients can find you

5. **Commit** with a clear, descriptive message
6. **Open a pull request** against `main`

### Code Conventions

- **Kotlin** with Jetpack Compose — no XML layouts
- **NIP implementations** go in `NipXX.kt` as Kotlin `object` with static helper functions
- **Events** are created via `NostrEvent.create(privkey, pubkey, kind, content, tags)`
- **Hex encoding** uses `ByteArray.toHex()` / `String.hexToByteArray()` extensions
- **Coroutines** for all async work — `Dispatchers.Default` for CPU-bound, `Dispatchers.IO` for network
- **StateFlow** for UI state, **SharedFlow** for relay events
- Keep functions small and focused. Prefer clarity over cleverness.
